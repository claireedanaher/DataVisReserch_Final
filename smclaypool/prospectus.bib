abstract = {People have difficulty understanding statistical information and are unaware of their wrong judgments, particularly in Bayesian reasoning. Psychology studies suggest that the way Bayesian problems are represented can impact comprehension, but few visual designs have been evaluated and only populations with a specific background have been involved. In this study, a textual and six visual representations for three classic problems were compared using a diverse subject pool through crowdsourcing. Visualizations included area-proportional Euler diagrams, glyph representations, and hybrid diagrams combining both. Our study failed to replicate previous findings in that subjects' accuracy was remarkably lower and visualizations exhibited no measurable benefit. A second experiment confirmed that simply adding a visualization to a textual Bayesian problem is of little help, even when the text refers to the visualization, but suggests that visualizations are more effective when the text is given without numerical values. We discuss our findings and the need for more such experiments to be carried out on heterogeneous populations of non-experts.},

@article{Gigerenzer1995,
abstract = {G. Gigerenzer and U. Hoffrage (1995) claimed that Bayesian inference problems, which have been notoriously difficult for laypeople to solve using base rates, hit rates, and false-alarm rates, become computationally simpler when information is presented with frequencies based on natural sampling. They made an evolutionary argument for the improved performance. The authors of the present article show that performance can improve with either probabilities or frequencies, depending on the rareness of the events and the type of information presented. When events are rare, probabilities are more difficult to understand than frequencies (i.e., 5 out of 1,000 vs. .005.). Furthermore, when the information is presented as joint and marginal events, nested sets become more apparent. Frequencies based on natural sampling have these desirable properties. The authors agree with Gigerenzer and Hoffrage that frequencies can improve Bayesian reasoning, but they attribute that improvement to the use of mental models that involve elements of nested sets.

abstract = {Decades of research have repeatedly shown that people perform poorly at estimating and understanding conditional probabilities that are inherent in Bayesian reasoning problems. Yet in the medical domain, both physicians and patients make daily, life-critical judgments based on conditional probability. Although there have been a number of attempts to develop more effective ways to facilitate Bayesian reasoning, reports of these findings tend to be inconsistent and sometimes even contradictory. For instance, the reported accuracies for individuals being able to correctly estimate conditional probability range from 6{\%} to 62{\%}. In this work, we show that problem representation can significantly affect accuracies. By controlling the amount of information presented to the user, we demonstrate how text and visualization designs can increase overall accuracies to as high as 77{\%}. Additionally, we found that for users with high spatial ability, our designs can further improve their accuracies to as high as 100{\%}. By and large, our findings provide explanations for the inconsistent reports on accuracy in Bayesian reasoning tasks and show a significant improvement over existing methods. We believe that these findings can have immediate impact on risk communication in health-related fields},

abstract = {Proper Bayesian reasoning is critical across a broad swath of domains that require practitioners to make predictions about the probability of events contingent upon earlier actions or events. However, much research on judgment has shown that people who are unfamiliar with Bayes' Theorem often reason quite poorly with conditional probabilities due to various cognitive biases. As such, this dissertation chronicles the development and evaluation of an interactive visualization designed to aid Bayes-naive people in solving conditional probability problems, in part by leveraging its graphical properties to head off the occurrence of biases. In three experiments, the visualization was tested with different classes of Bayesian problems. Experiment 1 showed that participants using the interactive visualization substantially improved their reasoning performance above that of previous debiasing methods for common, academic elementary Bayesian problems. Experiment 2 suggests that some measure of this improvement is retained for more complicated chains of reasoning Bayesian problems, with the majority of benefit going to those participants who self-assess themselves to be better in math ability than their peers. Experiment 3 showed that in real-time prediction/updating with a concrete, to-be-resolved Bayesian problem tied to a sporting event, participants using the visualization achieved better reasoning performance, seemed to suffer less from detrimental effects of overconfidence, and had internal reasoning accuracy that was solidly predictive of their accuracy with respect to matching the external event/world-a desirable property that allows for estimations of judges' outcome performance, based on readily available process information. Altogether, findings from three experiments point to visualizations being a rich area to mine, and prime candidate for expanding the toolbox of techniques that can be used to more accurately elicit the predictions of judges whose expertise lies beyond the realm of statistics.

abstract = {When web survey respondents self-administer a questionnaire, what they are doing is in many ways similar to what goes on in human–human interviews. The studies presented here demonstrate that enabling web survey respondents to engage in the equivalent of clarification dialogue can improve respondents' comprehension of questions and thus the accuracy of their answers, much as it can in human–human interviews. In two laboratory experiments, web survey respondents (1) answered more accurately when they could obtain clarification, that is, ground their understanding of survey questions, than when no clarification was available, and (2) answered particularly accurately with mixed-initiative clarification, where respondents could initiate clarification or the system could provide unsolicited clarification when respondents took too long to answer. Diagnosing the need for clarification based on respondent characteristics—in particular, age—proved more effective than relying on a generic model of all respondents' need for clarification. Although clarification dialogue increased response times, respondents preferred being able to request clarification than not. The current results suggest that bringing features of human dialogue to web surveys can exploit the advantages of both interviewer- and self-administration of questionnaires.

abstract = {Background: Physicians and medical students may lack sufficient numeracy skills to make treatment decisions, interpret test results, and practice evidence-based medicine. We evaluated whether the use of a tree diagram without numerical values as an aid for numerical processing might improve students' test results when dealing with percentages. Methods: A prospective randomized study was carried out with 102 third-year students. Participants received 3 diagnostic test problems and were asked to determine positive predictive values. The information in these tests was expressed either in (1) natural frequencies, (2) conditional probabilities, or (3) conditional probabilities with a tree diagram without numbers. Results: Ninety-eight (96.1{\%}) complete data sets could be obtained. The group working with natural frequencies achieved significantly higher test results (n = 29, mean score: 1.1, P = 0.045) than the group working with conditional probabilities (n = 34, mean score: 0.56). The students who were given a tree diagram in addition to conditional probabilities (n = 35, mean score: 1.26) also achieved significantly better scores than the group with conditional probabilities alone (P = 0.008). The difference between the group who had received natural frequencies and the group working with conditional probabilities and the tree diagram was not significant. Conclusions: We suggest the use of a tree diagram as a visual aid when dealing with diagnostic tests expressed in conditional probabilities.
