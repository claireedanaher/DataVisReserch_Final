## Aim of paper

The aim of this paper is to analyze and prove that frequency formats are an easier representation for Bayesian Reasoning than probabilities. 

## Conclusion

This paper concludes that providing humans with frequency information about a statistic rather than a probability value performed better than similar participants (people not familiar with statistics) when they were provided the same information but in a numerical or probability based format. 

This indicates that providing people with frequencies helps make people understand the problem of Bayesian Reasoning. 

## Project Relevance 

Our project, testing whether Bayesian Reasoning can be improved with an interactive information display, should leverage this to make a more informative view of the data. Basically, we should probably use frequency formats *within* our diagram. Otherwise, even if interaction improves Bayesian Reasoning, we might get an inconclusive result if the participants are confused by the probability values they won't show any benefit. 

Also, because so many people cite this work, we could follow this procedure to make our results comparable to other results in the field.

## Aim

This paper aims to discover and evaluate new techniques for improving Bayesian Reasoning by restricting or controlling the amount of information presented to a user, as well as different visualizations. 

## Conclusion 

By organizing and structuring the problem statement for users, they were able to improve Bayesian Reasoning. But, overall, people still seemed to perform poorly on Bayesian tasks. 

## Relevance     

This paper will be very important to our experiment. This paper has a very detailed experiment design (partially shared with other papers). So, it would be good for us to model the design used in this paper so that our results are as generalizable

## Aim 

To evaluate if using a tree diagram as a reference while dealing with percentages (Bayesian reasoning) would help medical professionals and medical students make correct decisions about statistics. 

## Conclusion

This paper found a statistically significant benefit for using a tree diagram as a reference for Bayesian Reasoning than just being given the numbers. Interestingly, the group that was given both the tree diagram reference with conditional probabilities did *not* perform (statistically) significantly better than the group that was given frequencies. This could suggest that the benefits gained from using frequencies rather than probabilities are not cumulative with the benefit of the tree diagram. 

## Relevance 

This paper is useful in a few ways. First, they provide a clean protocol for providing reference diagrams to help reasoning. Second, their result that frequencies did not show a statistical difference from the diagram could be explored further; we could (with enough trials) test using both frequencies and probabilities with our interactive diagram. It could be that redundant logical representations of these probabilities are not cumulatively helpful. 

Finally, this paper bring up an interesting point: you are often given probabilities, and the act of converting to frequencies could cause errors before reasoning about the probabilities. So, having a more general tool that eliminates the need to convert to frequencies (or helps with that calculation) could be helpful to incorporate into our test design.
